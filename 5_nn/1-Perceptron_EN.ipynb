    "## Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptron is a a linear classification model of dichotomy, the input is the egienvector of instance and the output is other category of instance(take +1 and -1). The perceptron corresponds to a separate hyperplane in which the instance is divided into two classes in the input space. The perceptron aims to find the hyperplane. In order to find the hyperplane, the loss function based on misclassification is introduced. The gradient descent method is used to optimize the loss function (optimization).Perceptron learning algorithm is simple and easy to implement. It can be divided into primitive form and dual form. Perceptron prediction is a discriminant model, beacause it uses the peceptron model through learning to predict the new instance. Perceptronsis proposed by Rosenblatt in 1957, are the basis of neural networks and support vector machines.\n",

    "Psychologist Rosenblatt conceive perception machine, as a simplified mathematical model to explain how neurons in the brain work: it took a set of binary input values (nearby neurons), multiply each input value by a continuous value weight (near each neuron synaptic strength), and setting up a threshold, if the weighted input value is more than the threshold, the output is 1, otherwise 0 (similarly in the neurons discharge process). For perceptrons, most of the input values are either data or outputs from other perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Donald Hebb proposed an unexpected and far-reaching idea that knowledge and learning occur in the brain mainly through the formation and change of synapses between neurons, which is briefly described as Hebb's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> When cell A's axons are close enough to excite cell B, and repeatedly and continuously discharge cell B, some growth process or metabolic changes will occur in one or both of these cells, so that A becomes more efficient as one of the cells that discharge B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perception machine has not completely follow the idea. **However, by the weight of the input value, we can have a very simple and intuitive learning plan: the training set of a given an input/output instance, perception machine should \"learn\" a function: for each example, if the output value is much lower than the instance, then increase the weight of it, otherwise if the value is much higher than the instance, reduce the weight of it.**\n"
