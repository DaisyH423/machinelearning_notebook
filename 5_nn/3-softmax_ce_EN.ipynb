    "Softmax(Flexible maximum) function, usually in neural network, can work as the output layer of classification assignment. Actually we can think of softmax output as the probability of selecting several categories. For example, If I have a classification task that is divided into three classes, the Softmax function can output the probability of the selection of the three classes based on their relative size, and the probability sum is 1.\n",
